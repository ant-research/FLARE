## 📖 Overview
We present FLARE, a feed-forward model that simultaneously estimates high-quality camera poses, 3D geometry, and appearance from as few as 2-8 uncalibrated images. Our cascaded learning paradigm:

1. **Camera Pose Estimation**: Directly regress camera poses without bundle adjustment
2. **Geometry Reconstruction**: Decompose geometry reconstruction into two simpler sub-problems
3. **Appearance Modeling**: Enable photorealistic novel view synthesis via 3D Gaussians

Achieves SOTA performance with inference times <0.5 seconds!

## 🛠️ TODO List
- [x] Release point cloud and camera pose estimation code.
- [x] Updated Gradio demo (app.py).
- [x] Release novel view synthesis code.
- [x] Release evaluation code.
- [x] Release training code.
- [ ] Release data processing code.

## 🌍 Installation

```
conda create -n flare python=3.8
conda activate flare 
conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia  # use the correct version of cuda for your system
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda uninstall ffmpeg  
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```


## 💿 Checkpoints
Download the checkpoint from [huggingface_geometry](https://huggingface.co/AntResearch/FLARE/blob/main/geometry_pose.pth) [huggingface_nvs](https://huggingface.co/zhang3z/FLARE_NVS/blob/main/NVS.pth) and place it in the checkpoints/geometry_pose.pth and checkpoints/NVS.pth directory.

## 🎯 Run a Demo (Point Cloud and Camera Pose Estimation) 


```bash
sh scripts/run_pose_pointcloud.sh
```


```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 run_pose_pointcloud.py \
    --test_dataset "1 @ CustomDataset(split='train', ROOT='Your/Data/Path', resolution=(512,384), seed=1, num_views=7, gt_num_image=0, aug_portrait_or_landscape=False, sequential_input=False)" \
    --model "AsymmetricMASt3R(pos_embed='RoPE100', patch_embed_cls='ManyAR_PatchEmbed', img_size=(512, 512), head_type='catmlp+dpt', output_mode='pts3d+desc24', depth_mode=('exp', -inf, inf), conf_mode=('exp', 1, inf), enc_embed_dim=1024, enc_depth=24, enc_num_heads=16, dec_embed_dim=768, dec_depth=12, dec_num_heads=12, two_confs=True, desc_conf_mode=('exp', 0, inf))" \
    --pretrained "Your/Checkpoint/Path" \
    --test_criterion "MeshOutput(sam=False)" --output_dir "log/" --amp 1 --seed 1 --num_workers 0
```

**To run the demo using ground truth camera poses:**
Enable the wpose=True flag in both the CustomDataset and AsymmetricMASt3R. An example script demonstrating this setup is provided in run_pose_pointcloud_wpose.sh.

```bash
sh scripts/run_pose_pointcloud_wpose.sh
```




## 👀 Visualization 

```
sh ./visualizer/vis.sh
```
 

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python visualizer/run_vis.py --result_npz data/mesh/IMG_1511.HEIC.JPG.JPG/pred.npz --results_folder data/mesh/IMG_1511.HEIC.JPG.JPG/
``` 

## 📽️ Evaluating Novel View Synthesis

You can evaluate the novel view synthesis on RealEstate10K dataset using the following command:

```
sh scripts/run_eval_nvs.sh
```

### RealEstate10K Dataset

Our model uses the same training and test datasets as pixelSplat. Below we quote pixelSplat's [detailed instructions](https://github.com/dcharatan/pixelsplat?tab=readme-ov-file#acquiring-datasets) on getting datasets.

> pixelSplat was trained using versions of the RealEstate10k and ACID datasets that were split into ~100 MB chunks for use on server cluster file systems. Small subsets of the Real Estate 10k and ACID datasets in this format can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1joiezNCyQK2BvWMnfwHJpm2V77c7iYGe?usp=sharing). To use them, simply unzip them into a newly created `datasets` folder in the project root directory.

> If you would like to convert downloaded versions of the Real Estate 10k and ACID datasets to our format, you can use the [scripts here](https://github.com/dcharatan/real_estate_10k_tools). Reach out to us (pixelSplat) if you want the full versions of our processed datasets, which are about 500 GB and 160 GB for Real Estate 10k and ACID respectively.

## 📈 Training
You can train the model on the CO3D dataset using the following command:

```bash
sh scripts/train.sh
```
For more training configurations, please refer to [DUSt3R](https://github.com/cvg/DUSt3R).  
We gratefully acknowledge the authors for their excellent implementation.


## 🧭 Evaluation
You can evaluate pose estimation on the RealEstate10K dataset using the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/test_re10k.sh
```

DTU dataset can be evaluated using the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/test_dtu.sh
```


ETH3D dataset can be evaluated using the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/test_dtu.sh
```
